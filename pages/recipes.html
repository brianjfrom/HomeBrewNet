        <p>	Into a boiling pot added 2 1/2 gallons of distilled water, added the grain bags with the crystal and roasted malt. Placed the pot onto the stove and started the boil.

At boil add the fuggle hops and let boil for 50 minutes. In the last five minutes of the 50 I added the cascade hops and let them boil. At end of boil, removed the hops and cooled the wort. To a clean carboy, add 2 1/2 gallons of spring water, then add the cooled wort and then pitch the yeast, cover and place on a water lock.

                    <h4>Directions:</h4>
                    <p>Prepare the yeast starter a day or two before brew day.
                    Crush the speciality grains and malt, and mix them with the Oats in a course, nylon bag. Tie the bag into a knot to seal it. Heat 3 gallons of water to 155* F in a pot with a lid add the nylon bag of grains. Keep the pot covered, maintaining a temperature between 150* and 158* F for one hour to convert the starch. This can be done, for example, by placing the entire pot in an over that has been preheated to 150* F. Remove the grain bag and pour 1 qt of rinse water over into the pot. This rinses some of the residual sugars from the grains. In a seperate pot bring 3 gallons of water to a boil for at least 15 minutes. Add 2 of these gallons to a clean, sanitized fermenter. Keep the other gallon of water coverd, in reserve. Bring the wort to a boil and slowly but vigorously mix in the dry malt extract. Boil the wort vigorously for 15 minutes and add the hops. Boil for 30 more minutes and add the Irish moss and boil 15 minutes more. Total boil time is 60 minutes. Cool the wort to room temperature within 30 minutes of the end of boil. Siphon the wort off of the trub, into the fermenter, adding the reserved water as necessary to bring the final wort volume to 5.5 gallons. <br>
                    Aerate the wort for 15 minutes. Mix in the yeast starter to the wort. Seal the fermenter with an air lock and ferment as usual.</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li>2 large cans of apple juice.  (frozen, from concentrate)</li>
                            <li>1 cup white granulated sugar.</li>
                            <li>1 pkg (any brand) champaine yeast</li>

                          <h4>Procedure:</h4>
                          <p>1.  Let the frozon apple juice thaw. <br>
                            2.  Add to a one gallon container, the two large cans of apple julce, with about half of the container with water. <br>
                            3.  In a seperate cup heat one cup of water to boiling, than add the one cup of sugar to the boiling water.  Making sure that the sugar disolves. <br>
                            4.  Add the sugar water to the  julice/water. <br>
                            5.  Fill the container almost to the top, leaving a little bit of head space for the yeast to grow. <br>
                            6.  If the container is to room temperature, which it should be, reconsitute your yeast and add it to the apple juice.<br>
                            7.  Add a water lock and let ferment, this process may take anywhere from 1 week to several.</p>
                            <h4>Bottling procedure:</h4>
                            <p><b>For sparking Cider:</b> Bottle in beer bottles and prime like you would beer, except this a one gallon batch.  Instead of 3/4 of a cup priming sugar, add 3/20 of a cup, or 1.2 oz. <br><br>
                            <b>For Wine Like Cider:</b> Wait for the cider to finish fermenting, then give the cider about another week,  Just to be safe.  Then you may want to rent a corker, or if you have one all the better.  A one gallon batch usually yields between 5 and 6 bottles of cider depending on the bottle.  Add the cider to the bottles and add corks.  Let sit minimum of 3 weeks before opening.</p>
