       <li>1 lb Crystal malt</li>
       <li>1/4 lb roasted malt</li>

     <h4>Directions</h4>
     <p>	Into a boiling pot added 2 1/2 gallons of distilled water, added the grain bags with the crystal and roasted malt. Placed the pot onto the stove and started the boil. Just before the boil, removed the grains. At full boil add the 6 lbs. of amber malt. Placed the pot back on to the stove, and got the wort boiling again. At boil add the fuggle hops and let boil for 50 minutes. In the last five minutes of the 50 I added the cascade hops and let them boil. At end of boil, removed the hops and cooled the wort. To a clean carboy, add 2 1/2 gallons of spring water, then add the cooled wort and then pitch the yeast, cover and place on a water lock.
     <br>Let the wort ferment for about 15 days then bottled. After the bottling I let the beer condition for around 2 weeks. </p>
